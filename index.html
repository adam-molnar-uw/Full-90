                    Piriformis release is critical for ischial tuberosity recovery. Glutes release 3x/day maintains tissue quality around the nerve. Banded hip abduction directly activates glute med — do it right after glute release (release then activate). This offloads the chronically overworked TFL on the left side. Hollow hold builds core stability that protects everything else. The foot exercises (short foot, big toe press-downs, towel scrunches) rebuild intrinsic foot strength that your orthotics suppress. The ankle work (single-leg balance, alphabet tracing, banded dorsiflexion) is bilateral — L ankle for hypermobility control, R ankle for stability around the plantar plate and orthotics. Do foot and ankle work barefoot at home.
